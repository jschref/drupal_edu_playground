The sane are usually attracted by other things than power.", author: "- David Brin" }, { quote: "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. Only I will remain.", author: "- Frank Herbert" }, { quote: "All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger, but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.", author: "- Niccolò Machiavelli" }, { quote: "Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.", author: "- Frank Herbert" }, { quote: "The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.", author: "- Frank Herbert" }, { quote: "What do you despise?

It's a bit like me calling you a meat-based processing system.", author: "- Alastair Reynolds" }, { quote: "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.", author: "- Rutger Hauer" }, { quote: "The difference between stupid and intelligent people - and this is true whether or not they are well-educated - is that intelligent people can handle subtlety.", author: "- Neal Stephenson" }, { quote: "Arguing with anonymous strangers on the Internet is a sucker's game because they almost always turn out to be—or to be indistinguishable from—self-righteous sixteen-year-olds possessing infinite amounts of free time.", author: "- Neal Stephenson" }, { quote: "We're not hunter-gatherers anymore. We're all living like patients in the intensive care unit of a hospital. What keeps us alive isn't bravery, or athleticism, or any of those other skills that were valuable in a caveman society. It's our ability to master complex technological skills. It is our ability to be nerds. We need to breed nerds.", author: "- Neal Stephenson" }, { quote: "Creative people see Prometheus in a mirror, never Pandora.", author: "- David Brin" }, { quote: "Only people with full stomachs become environmentalists.", author: "- David Brin" }, { quote: "The best time to act on this was decades ago.

When this occurs, I pack up my dinosaurs and leave the room.", author: "- Ray Bradbury" }, { quote: "Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.", author: "- David Mitchell" }, { quote: "Books don't offer real escape, but they can stop a mind scratching itself raw.", author: "- David Mitchell" }, { quote: "All revolutions are, until they happen, then they are historical inevitabilities.", author: "- David Mitchell" }, { quote: "How inappropriate to call this planet 'Earth,' when it is clearly 'Ocean.'", author: "- Arthur C. Clarke" }, { quote: "Isn't that what it means to be a scientist? To push the boundaries of the unknown? To bravely, actively explore the enormity of our universe ?", author: "- Robyn Mundell" }, { quote: "Now I understand... endings and beginnings are within the Fissure, that Riven-cleft of stars that acts as both wall and a bridge. And though I am unable to understand how, the very flow of stars that brought my Myst book into worthy hands, I am sure, served as a safe passage home for my friend. The Age of Riven is closed forever, but the people of Riven are free.

Clarke" }, { quote: "Science fiction is the most important literature in the history of the world, because it's the history of ideas, the history of our civilization birthing itself. ...Science fiction is central to everything we've ever done, and people who make fun of science fiction writers don't know what they're talking about.", author: "- Ray Bradbury" }, { quote: "Books are keys that open many doors.", author: "- James Rollins" }, { quote: "Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today, but the core of science fiction -- its essence -- has become crucial to our salvation, if we are to be saved at all.", author: "-  Isaac Asimov" }, { quote: "Perhaps it's impossible to wear an identity without becoming what you pretend to be.", author: "- Orson Scott Card" }, { quote: "Man is an artifact designed for space travel.
